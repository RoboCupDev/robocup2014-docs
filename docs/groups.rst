Groups
======

Introduction
------------

As you have already seen in the previous chapter the menu item that will
take you to the group management module of the system is located in
top-central part of any tournamenter page. When you click in on it for the
first time you will most likely see a screen that is very similar to this
one:

.. image:: img/group-empty.png
    :alt: The group listing without any groups in it.

That means that there are no groups at the moment. When you clikc on the
big **Create New Button** a new group will be added with default values
prefilled and your screen will look like this:

.. image:: img/group-new.png
    :alt: The group listing with one new empty group.
